// Feeling Empty and sad After Finishing games of Throneint 

/*

Jon Snow is the kind of character who carries the weight of the world without ever asking for it. He grows up believing he’s less than everyone else, a bastard, an outsider. 
But he’s the one who always does what’s right, even when it breaks him. He’s loyal to the people who never fully accepted him. He sacrifices love, power, and peace for duty. 
And in the end, he’s cast aside again, sent to the cold where it all began.
He’s not the king who sits on a throne. He’s the king who walks away from it because he’s too honorable to take it by force, and too dangerous to be allowed to keep it.
Jon Snow is the dragon who never burned anyone for power. He’s the wolf who never stopped protecting the pack. And that’s what makes him unforgettable.
